- name: Interpretable Machine Learning for Echelle Spectroscopy with blase
  description: >
    Recent innovations in machine learning (ML) have shown how powerful the technology can be in our everyday lives.  Adapting ML to science has immense promise, but usually suffers from uninterpretability: Neural Architectures yield powerful predictions but cannot be easily interrogated for why they made such a prediction.  Our open source blase framework incorportates the powerful autodiff and GPU support from PyTorch on an interpretable physics-based substrate to yield the best of both worlds: the speed, scalability, and flexibility of ML with the heritage of hundreds of years of physical chemistry.

- name: Quantifying starspots and their implications for stellar ages
  description: >
    Starspots have occupied a major avenue of my recent research focus, leading in part to my work at Kepler/K2.  Kepler researchers take for granted the mere existence of starspots as the dominant method of assigning rotation periods to stars.  My major breakthrough on starspots came when I realized that starspots possess both the familiar "AC" signal, but also a less familiar "DC" signal, a part of starspot geometry that is always visible from the perspective of the observer.

- name: Probabilistic spectral inference with modular extensions to Starfish
  description: >
    Echelle spectrographs like IGRINS possess an immense spectral grasp, presenting both a scientific competitive advantage, and an analysis challenge: "How to we leverage all of that data?  How do you compare it to imperfect models?"  For the last 8 years I have developed computational approaches to overcome those challenges.  The Starfish technique emulates synthetic spectra from pre-computed stellar model grids to compare with IGRINS data in a probabilistic way.  My work has centered around extending the code to model starspots, protostars, brown dwarfs, and subgiants.

- name: Silicon Immersion gratings
  description: >
    The Jaffe Silicon Diffractive Optics Group has been making diffraction gratings out of monocrystalline silicon for over 4 decades.  Silicon is an excellent optical material in the infrared because of its high (_n_ = 3.4) refractive index, which shrinks Si immersed wavelength, and reduces the overall size (and cost) of an infrared spectrograph design by a factor of about 3 to 10.  Weisong Wang and I custom-made the Si immersion grating for IGRINS.
