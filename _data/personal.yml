intro:
  title: hello, most folks just call me gully
  body: >
    I am a multidisciplinary scientist and technologist living in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Last year I was a postdoctoral reseacher at the [Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China, where I developed a statistical inference framework to detect two-component photospheres in stellar spectra.  My work resulted in the measurement of an emergent spectrum arising from starspots, one of the [most robust measurements of its kind](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06703) for such a weak signal.  At the University of Texas at Austin I led metrology with the Silicon Diffractive Optics Group.  I patterned exceptionally precise grooves on oversized silicon wafers the size of hockey pucks, adapting photolithography techniques developed for the VLSI semiconductor industry.  During a NASA GSRP fellowship at the [JPL Microdevices Lab](http://microdevices.jpl.nasa.gov/) I improved the precision of these devices [even](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9151E..5KG) [further](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApOpt..5410177G).  In the last 4 years I have pivoted to interests in modern software technology, and how methods adapt to and leverage the increasingly data-rich environment.  I've also played tenor sax in a [renegade street band](http://www.minormishap.com).
