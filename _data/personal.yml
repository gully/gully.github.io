intro:
  title: hi.
  body: >
    I am an astronomy graduate student at [UT Austin](http://www.as.utexas.edu/), and former [NASA GSRP fellow at JPL](http://microdevices.jpl.nasa.gov/).  My multidisciplinary research includes elements of astronomical instrumentation, device development, nanotechnolody, optics, computing, software development, statistics, data mining, and visualization.  My astronomical projects are aimed at detecting and characterizing some of the lowest mass young brown dwarfs in [nearby star forming regions](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110414.html).  I'm excited about the next generation of [ambitious astronomical instrumentation](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20130307-peering-into-the-early-universe/), in which [data science skills will feature prominently](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20131002-a-digital-copy-of-the-universe-encrypted/).
