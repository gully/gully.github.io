intro:
  title: hello, most folks just call me gully
  body: >
    I am a scientist and technologist living in Austin, Texas.  I characterize stars and exoplanets using high resolution spectroscopy and probabilistic inference.  I recently joined the Exoplanet Atmospheres research group with UT Austin Professor [Caroline Morley](https://www.carolinemorley.com/).  We want to measure the atmospheres of exoplanets, with a long view of finding out which exoplanets are habitable.  I specialize in quantifying [astrophysical uncertainty](https://speakerdeck.com/gully/know-thy-planet-know-thy-starspots) in the atmospheric measurement process.  Previously I worked for the [K2 mission](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/), which continues to revolutionize our understanding of exoplanets and [stellar activity](https://speakerdeck.com/gully/k2-and-igrins-constrain-starspot-filling-factors-and-temperatures) among other topics.  I contribute to the scientific Python ecosystem including the [lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org/) toolkit for time series data anlysis and the spectral inference framework [Starfish](https://github.com/gully/Starfish).  For my PhD I led metrology with the UT Austin [Silicon Diffractive Optics Group](https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/research/people/jaffe/micro_si_diff.html), where I lithographically patterned immersion gratings.  During a NASA GSRP fellowship at the [JPL Microdevices Lab](http://microdevices.jpl.nasa.gov/) I improved the precision of these devices [even](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9151E..5KG) [further](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApOpt..5410177G).  Recently I've become excited about [GPUs](https://speakerdeck.com/gully/gpus-for-astronomy-data), [autodiff](https://github.com/google/jax), and other modern numerical innovations that stand to catalyze astronomical discovery.
