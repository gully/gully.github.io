intro:
  title: hello, most folks just call me gully
  body: >
    I am a scientist and technologist living in Austin, Texas.  My research centers on characterizing stars and exoplanets using probabilistic inference and machine learning.  I'm a member of the Exoplanet Atmospheres research group led by UT Austin Professor [Caroline Morley](https://www.carolinemorley.com/).  My current programs touch on quantifying stellar activity, detecting exospheres, and developing modern methods.  We recently made a neat new interpretable machine learning framework for high-resolution spectroscopy, [blase](https://github.com/gully/blase).  I also developed the [muler](https://github.com/OttoStruve/muler), [gollum](https://gollum-astro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [ynot](https://ynot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python projects, and have previously maintained to [lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org/) and [Starfish](https://github.com/gully/Starfish). I extended Starfish to model [starspots](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...836..200G/abstract), [protostars](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...862...85G/abstract), [brown dwarfs](https://github.com/gully/jammer-Gl570D), and [subgiants](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925....5G/abstract).

    I have previously worked at the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office at NASA Ames, and the Kavli Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics in Beijing, China.  My PhD focused on developing [Silicon Diffractive Optics](https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/research/people/jaffe/micro_si_diff.html) with nanoscience, including e-beam lithography at the [JPL Microdevices Lab](http://microdevices.jpl.nasa.gov/).  Lately I am developing scalable techniques to overcome the daunting challenge of meeting substellar JWST spectra at their native spectral resolution and bandwidth.
