intro:
  title: hello, most folks just call me gully
  body: >
    I am a scientist and technologist living in Austin, Texas.  My research centers on characterizing stars and exoplanets using probabilistic inference and machine learning.  I'm a member of the Exoplanet Atmospheres research group led by UT Austin Professor [Caroline Morley](https://www.carolinemorley.com/).  My programs touch on quantifying [starspots](https://speakerdeck.com/gully/know-thy-planet-know-thy-starspots), detecting exospheres, and developing scalable spectral inference.  We recently made a new interpretable machine learning framework for high-resolution spectroscopy, [blasé](https://github.com/gully/blase).  I also developed the [muler](https://github.com/OttoStruve/muler), [gollum](https://gollum-astro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [ynot](https://ynot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python libraries, and have previously maintained [lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org/) and [Starfish](https://github.com/gully/Starfish).

    I have previously worked at the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office at NASA Ames, and the Kavli Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics in Beijing, China.  My PhD focused on developing [Silicon Diffractive Optics](https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/research/people/jaffe/micro_si_diff.html) with nanoscience, including e-beam lithography at the [JPL Microdevices Lab](http://microdevices.jpl.nasa.gov/).  Lately I am developing scalable techniques to overcome the daunting challenge of modeling substellar JWST spectra at their native spectral resolution and bandwidth.
