intro:
  title: hello, most folks just call me gully
  body: >
    I am a scientist and technologist living in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I work on the [Kepler spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(spacecraft)), the most successful [planet-finding](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) telescope in history.  My focus has centered on the ongoing [K2 mission](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/), which continues to revolutionize our understanding of [starspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starspot), [supernovae](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7086), [white dwarfs](http://www.k2wd.org/), [stellar jitter](https://rvxk2.com/), and more.  I continue to develop and apply modular extensions to the statistical spectral inference framework [Starfish](https://github.com/gully/Starfish).  I used to lead metrology with the UT Austin Silicon Diffractive Optics Group, where I photolithographically patterned precise grooves on oversized silicon wafers the size of hockey pucks.  During a NASA GSRP fellowship at the [JPL Microdevices Lab](http://microdevices.jpl.nasa.gov/) I improved the precision of these devices [even](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9151E..5KG) [further](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApOpt..5410177G).  Recently I've become excited about scaling massive astronomical data analysis challenges with [distributed systems](https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) and [GPU-enabled inference frameworks](http://pytorch.org/).
