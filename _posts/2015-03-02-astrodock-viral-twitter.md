title:      astrodock is a viral Twitter meme

summary:    Last Wednesday night I inadvertantly catalyzed a viral Twitter meme.  I had just seen a talk, and in the few moments before the presenter fired up his Keynote presentation, his idle Desktop caught my attention.  Lined along the bottom was the familiar OSX Dock- that colorful destination for our most-used applications.  He had so many different icons I had never seen before.  I realized that this practice had become something I look forward to when I go to presentations.  So, naturally, I tweeted about it, and \#astrodock was conceived, and subsequently born.

Last Wednesday night I inadvertantly catalyzed a viral Twitter meme.  I had just seen a talk, and in the few moments before the presenter fired up his Keynote presentation, his idle Desktop caught my attention.  Lined along the bottom was the familiar OSX Dock- that colorful destination for our most-used applications.  He had so many different icons I had never seen before.  I realized that this practice had become something I look forward to when I go to presentations.  So, naturally, I tweeted about it.

Jonathan Sick suggested making a blog about it, which reminded me of the tech/design website [usethis.com](http://usesthis.com/) which highlights hardware and software setups, and [this Nature article series](http://www.nature.com/news/my-digital-toolbox-nuclear-engineer-katy-huff-on-version-control-systems-1.16014), which highlighted scientist workflows.  Adrian Price-Whelan chimed in, and started the viral microblogging hashtag #astrodock.

Rather than repost the docks, all the original content is still available on Twitter, by simply searching for [\#astrodock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/astrodock?src=hash).  Here were some insights:


1. All the cool kids are using [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) instead of the bland default Terminal.
2. Some people use [Bibdesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) some use [PapersApp](http://www.papersapp.com/).
3. Thereâ€™s something called [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) for reading PDFs.
4. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is popular.
5. Some people use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/), and [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/).
6. Long tail of [random app icons that are un-Googleable](https://twitter.com/karinsandstrom/status/570720285659246592).

Point number 6 above highlights the challenge of extracting further insights from the astrodock meme.  I think the astronomy community could stand to benefit from something like [usethis.com](http://usesthis.com/) or the Nature article.  But something that anyone can edit.  That's where Twitter shines- you don't need permission to post.  Tweet at me if you think of a way to facilitate a hybrid macro/micro blog for Astronomy hardware and software setups.
